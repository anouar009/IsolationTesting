Run the Script with Bypass:

Use the following command to run  script while bypassing the execution policy for that session:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\your\script.ps1"

Option 2: Modify the Script to Include Bypass
To include a bypass directly in your script, you can use the following technique. However, you will need to call this script from another script or command line.

Create a new script file named run_script.bat and include the following content:

@echo off
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\your\script.ps1"
